# A simple blog management application at the basic CRUD operation
A very first project that is result for studying and applying Typescript in NodeJS road map. There are several reasons that I make this project :
1. Adding Typescript in my programming skill set.
2. Enhancing strong typing skill and more structural in coding.
3. Applying Typescript in NodeJS project for building server side.
